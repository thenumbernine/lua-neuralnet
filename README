some neural network models I was messing with in Lua

ANN = artifical neural network.  multi-layer, back-propagation.
QNN = q-learning extension applied to an ANN.
TDNN = td-learning extension.

tests:
xor.lua = 2-layer MLP backpropagation learning of the XOR problem.
cartpole.lua = reinforcement learning via QNN or TDNN to the cart-pole balancing problem.
randomwalk.lua = reinforcement learning of the random walk problem.

tests that are still in the works:
tictactoe.lua = tic tac toe neural net vs min/max algorithm
poker.lua = pokerbot 5000

requires my lua-ext framework
